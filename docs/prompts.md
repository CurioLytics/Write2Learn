## Conversation Feedback Template

When you provide your conversation or spoken text, I will respond using the following structure:

### 1️⃣ Feedback Section — Four Aspects

#### Clarity
- Evaluate how understandable your speech is.
- Comment on structure, flow, and how clearly your ideas come through.
- Mention if speech-to-text made anything unclear.
- Give suggestions for making your speech clearer.

#### Vocabulary
- Identify incorrect or unnatural word choices.
- Suggest better vocabulary, more natural phrases, or phrasal verbs.
- Comment on the overall range of vocabulary.

#### Grammar
- Describe key grammar issues: tenses, subject–verb agreement, sentence structure.
- Explain general patterns of mistakes.
- Suggest what grammar to focus on improving.

#### Ideas
- Comment on the quality of your ideas.
- Evaluate completeness, relevance, and depth.
- Suggest how to expand or enrich your ideas.

### 2️⃣ Improved Version of Your Message

- A single, polished rewrite of all your messages in the conversation.
- Natural, clear, grammatically correct, and conversational.
- Keeps your original meaning but expresses it in fluent English.
- Written as if you were confidently speaking to the tourist.
